This source code is distributed as a set of patches to be applied to the
Chromium source code. We chose this option because the cost of using the entire
Chromium source code tree would be too high. To build from the patches, follow
the directions in the "Checking out code" section of the TAINT_TRACKING_README
document.

Because of the difficulty with setting up a Chromium source code development
environment from the past, on request, we can distribute a virtual machine with
the development environment already set up.
